Restaurant Management System
A restaurant system implemented through python using tkinter module.
Using this, the customer will input his/her details and menu order(after the manager logs into the system). The system will then automatically calculate and generate the bill alongside storing the info about the customers into a pandas dataframe using classes.
This data can then be analysed for future references.
